                <p>
                  Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12 aims to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns worldwide. This goal recognizes the need to decouple economic growth from resource use and environmental degradation. The targets of SDG 12 include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>                 
                    Promoting efficient use of natural resources
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Reducing waste generation
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Encouraging sustainable practices in production and consumption
                  </li>
                  <p>This involves addressing issues like food waste, excessive packaging, and unsustainable extraction of natural resources. Additionally, SDG 12 emphasizes the importance of educating individuals and industries about the benefits of sustainable practices and the long-term impacts of irresponsible consumption.</p>
